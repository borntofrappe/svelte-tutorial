# Premier League Table

Wikipedia highlights the 2020 to 2021 season of the [Premier League]() with a table dense of information. The goal of this project is to repurpose the data with different visualizations.

_Please note:_ to better understand the d3 logic behind the visualizations I created individual REPLs showing a minimal, working demo.
