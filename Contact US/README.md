## Notes

The project was partly prompted by a [freeCodeCamp challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator) on regular expressions, with the goal of assessing telephone numbers from the United States of America.

For the animation, I created a [separate REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/952381e99df740498465cc53139c09aa) to experiment with the spring module from the Svelte library.
