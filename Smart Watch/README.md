# [Smart Watch](https://codepen.io/borntofrappe/full/bGGWMBx)

## How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

This project is inspired by a gadget proposed in the pokemon game series, a smart watch with a plethora of applications. I set out to recreate a few of them to highlight the potential of a component-based approach.

### res

In the `res` folder you find a series of sub-folders describing the building blocks behind the application and the different components. By dedicating separate files I was able to focus on the SVG syntax and final design without worrying too much about the functionality.

## Applications

Currently, the smart watch includes the following gadgets:

- digital clock

- calculator

- counter

- analog watch
