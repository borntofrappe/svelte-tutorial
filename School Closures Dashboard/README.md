# School Closures Dashboard

The project can be considered a follow-up of [School Closures Choropleth Map](https://github.com/borntofrappe/learning-d3/tree/master/School%20Closures%20Choropleth%20Map), where a choropleth map highlights the number of weeks in which school remained closed due to the Coronavirus pandemic at a global scale.

The goal is to here create a similar visualization, but focusing instead on the number of countries reporting a school closure. The map shows the data for a specific point in time, a day, but the idea is to then ehnance the visual with a slider and a transition, to highlight how the data evolved through time.
