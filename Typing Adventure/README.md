## How to Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes

In the `res` folder you find the UI(s) developed for the project. I designed the two screens of the application with [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org/), and I have a few notes about that journey in the `README.md` of that folder. Unfortunately, I wasn't immediately able to reuse the code in the `.svelte` files, and ended up creating my own "splitting component" to replicate the feat achieved by the library.
