## Notes

Every project in this repository tries to showcase Svelte and its features. Here, however, I am interested in two frameworks leaning on Svelte to build full-fledged applications: [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

SvelteKit is fundamentally the evolution of Sapper, and the soon-to-be recommended way to develop applications with Svelte from the Svelte team itself. That being said, I consider the exercise of using both frameworks useful to:

1. get acquainted with the structure of an application with multiple routes; the structure is largery similar for both projects

2. highlight the improvements proposed by the new framework
