# [F1 Tyres](https://svelte.dev/repl/f500057f49ba407cbc9f1d094a107e4e?version=3.43.0)

The project is centered around a type of column chart proposed on the [F1 website](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.strategy-guide-what-are-the-possible-race-strategies-for-the-russian-grand.292fIM7raBljiTrw2XRscl.html) to analyse a couple of metrics on different tyre compounds. The goal is to immediately recreate the chart, and then repurpose the information with a more striking visual.

The end result showcases the flexibility of the D3, but most importantly for this repository, how rapid and clear it is to develop a data visualization through Svelte. As a superset of HTML, it is enough to focus on the markup and SVG syntax. Svelte then injects enough logic to update the visualization according to the input data.
