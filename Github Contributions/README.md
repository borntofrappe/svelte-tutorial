# [Github Contributions](https://svelte.dev/repl/756596b4f3af4f02bf23e572159f159c?version=3.38.2)

## Notes

Consider the way Github highlights the contributions to public repositories, for instance the contributions to [sveltekit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/graphs/contributors?from=2020-10-11&to=2021-05-11&type=c). The goal of this project is to replicate the visual with a series of area charts.
