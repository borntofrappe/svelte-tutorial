# [Thermometer App](https://codesandbox.io/s/thermometer-app-h8rho)

## Notes

The project is inspired by [this article](https://www.leparisien.fr/high-tech/honor-lance-un-smartphone-capable-de-prendre-votre-temperature-09-06-2020-8332161.php) describing the launch of a mobile phone natively equipped to check the temperature with infrared technology.

In terms of style, [this design](https://dribbble.com/shots/6768800-Grill-App) detailing the UI for an application devoted to grilling motivates the design of the application.

The `res` folder includes the SVG icons created for the project.
