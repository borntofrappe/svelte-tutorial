# Word Search

[Word search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search) describes a puzzle game where a sequence of words is hidden in a two-dimensional grid. The player is tasked to find the letters included in all possible directions.

_Please note:_ the project has been subject to a revision dated 27th May 2022, as I found a different, dare I say better, way to implement the logic associated with the algorithm and the interaction.

The project is built in increments and dedicated subfolders:

- [display](https://svelte.dev/repl/47f98762434441d3b594acc0d074ca64?version=3.48.0) considers how to display letters in a `<canvas>` or `<svg>` element

- [pins](https://svelte.dev/repl/2799fa8eb4eb408c98d36625ac29802d?version=3.48.0) describes how to receive user input, again with both elements

- [algorithm](https://svelte.dev/repl/f80fc1193bc04f6f88aeb95ddb292963?version=3.48.0) introduces the algorithm
