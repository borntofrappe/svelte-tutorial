# Colorful Building Bl.ocks

## Notes

To celebrate the 10th anniversary of [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), [the D3 community proposed](https://d3js.community/d3-parade-2021) to create a visualization with the data visualization library as the subject. With this project I intend to create a belated entry to such an initiative.

The goal is to consider the [Blockbuilder Search Data](https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/blockbuilder-search-data) and specifically the endpoint describing the colors used in the different blocks, `blocks-colors.json`.

_Please note:_ the plan I have for the visualization is complex enough to warrant a few smaller demos, which are developed in Svelte's own REPL. Here I document the efforts as I try to make the plan a reality.
