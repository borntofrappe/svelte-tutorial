# Colorful Building Bl.ocks

## Notes

To celebrate the 10th anniversary the community around the D3 proposed to create a visualization centered on the library itself. With this project I intend to create a belated entry to such an initiative. The goal is to show the colors used by projects created with [blockbuilder](https://blockbuilder.org/), a site responsible for the early stages of D3, within a `<canvas>` element. The colors are however and only highlighted following a neat animation with the `viewBox` of an `<svg>` element.
