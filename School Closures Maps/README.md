# School Closures Maps

The project can be considered a continuation of [School Closures Choropleth Map](https://github.com/borntofrappe/learning-d3/tree/master/School%20Closures%20Choropleth%20Map), a project focused on plotting a map with `d3/d3-geo` and `topojson/topojson` and `topojson/world-atlas`.

A first visualization tries to replicate the cited choropleth map, to introduce how the mapping libraries are incorporated in Svelte. A second visualization includes the map in an interactive dashboard.
