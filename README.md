# svelte-tutorial

A series of projects to practice with Svelte.

Each project should have a link redirecting to a live demo. That being said, it is possible to set up an environment to run the projects locally:

1. move into the desired folder

   ```bash
   cd "Light Bright"
   ```

2. install the necessary packages

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. `npm run dev`

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
