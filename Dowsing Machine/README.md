# Dowsing Machine

Recreate a small game from the Pokewalker system starting from [a demo]() using vanilla JavaScript.

## Notes

- I was sure a fan of comments

- I included vector graphics through `symbol` and `use` elements

- classes no longer necessary

- since the input is nested in the label it is no longer necessary to add the `for` attribute

- [group inputs](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/group-inputs)
