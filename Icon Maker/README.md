# [Icon Maker](https://svelte.dev/repl/44a0394acb4f408cb0115958c0fd76f6)

Starting from the SVG syntax behind a vector icon, the goal is to draw a shape with the Canvas API and [the Path2D interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Path2D). Once drawn, the idea is to allow and download the asset as a `.png` file.

## Icon

In the `res` folder you find the SVG syntax recreated in the project. It'd be mighty interesting to actually read through the document tree to create the necessary fill and strokes, but as a starting point, the idea is to take the heart shape and creating the same shape with the Canvas API and hard-coded instructions.
